# starbucks-cafe-website

This project is created as a final output for the 2nd semester of 2021-2022 in my university. It is a project based on a story about starbucks. It uses the oldest website programming language such as PHP with Javascript. This is a databased driven project so all the items listed in the menu.html is generated or loaded from a MySQL database.

It basically is an ordering website where customers are prompted to enter their full name before being able to order and proceed to the menu page. Afterwhich available beverages and food are then displayed where the customer can add their desired items into the cart. Upon viewing the cart, it will contain all the selected items and display the subtotal of your order. A checkout button is provided but doesn't require to provide any payments as it is only a project for a subject in the uni. 

Disclaimer: This project is only developed for educational purposes and is not intended to create a mock up website for starbucks.
